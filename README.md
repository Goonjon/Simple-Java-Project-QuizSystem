# Simple Project on Java
### Project Summary: This is a simple Java project focused on creating and managing a multiple-choice quiz system using JSON for data storage. The project allows an admin to add quiz questions, while students can log in to take the quiz, with results displayed at the end. The system supports user authentication, securely storing quiz questions and user credentials in JSON files, making it both efficient and easy to manage.

### Technologies I have used: 
- JDK 17
- IntelIJ Community Edition
- JSON: Used for storing, retrieving, parsing, and writing quiz data and user credentials.
- Gradle: For managing dependencies.
